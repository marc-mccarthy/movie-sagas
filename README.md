[Movie Sagas](https://movie-sagas-1.herokuapp.com/#/)

## Description

This is a movie page with a list of my favorite movies (some of them) that I could think of in five minutes. You are able to add, update, and delete movies. The page is listed in alphabetical order, but you can also search by top 10 by likes. Each movie can be liked below the poster. You can see the details of each movie by clicking on the poster.

## Interface

## Languages

JavaScript, CSS, HTML, Postgresql, and Markdown demonstrated.

## Packages

This is built using Node.js with React, Redux, Sagas, Express, Pg, Nodemon, DotEnv, Material UI, and Axios utilized.

## Future Updates

Will be adding a search bar and more features to sort through the movies. Adding new ways of styling as I learn different ways.
